  	<h2><u> Education:-</u>
 
 </h2> 
 

  <b> <i>	Every kid has his own vision of doing something unique in life.</i></b> <br> <br>
  	They dream to work in high professions like doctors, engineers, teacher or a wealthy businessman , or any other high-level professions. All such goals of kids can be achieved through education only. <br> <br>
<b> They say sword is mightier than a pen , But i believe that.</b> <br><br>

Education does not only offer a good job but also enhances the ability of an individual to understand life from a different perspective. Decent education enlightens many paths to move ahead. It makes us intellectually powerful by improving our expertise level, technical abilities,as well as tough problem solving capibilities.

<h2><u> Effective Studying:- </u>
	
</h2>
The main rule that you, as a student, should remember is that studying for a long time does not equal studying effectively. The longer you try to stay focused, the less information you retain as your brain seeks a little rest and makes you distracted. But that is just what the majority of students do when they try to catch up and get ready for exams. You can often see students pulling all-nighters before their finals, drinking lots of coffee. <br><br>

So, should you do the same? Certainly, not! Of course, it doesn’t mean that you don’t have to spend time reciting your notes at all. It just means that you can achieve much more in less time.

<h3>
	<u>Here are a few things that will help you spend your time studying more productively:- </u>
</h3>

<b>1. Pomodoro technique - </b> <br>
  The Pomodoro Technique works like this:<br>
1. Decide what you want to accomplish and estimate how long you will study for. Then break your work into pomodoros.<br>
2. Set a timer for 25 minutes, and start studying.<br>
3. Minimize your distractions during the pomodoro interval. <br>
4.After 25 minutes take a short 5-10 minute break. <br>
5. Repeat <br>
<br>

<b> 2. Meditation-</b> <br> Meditating for up to five, ten or even twenty minutes before studying allows you to calm your mind. You can start with five minutes as you get used to emptying your mind and focusing on your breathing. And then work up. <br><br>

<b> 3. Be a fast memorizer - </b> <br> Try to understand the information first. Information that is organized and makes sense to you is easier to memorize.
<br> <br>


<b> 4. Minimize Distraction</b> <br> - We all know that studying might be boring. That’s why a lot of students try to make this time a little bit more amusing by texting, watching TV, etc. However, this is just another form of procrastination.
<br><br>

<b> 5. Have Breaks -</b> <br> Even the sharpest mind needs breaks. It’s crucial to have rest in order to stay focused and organized. Take short breaks every 40-50 minutes of studying and spend them on snacking, listening to music, etc. You will definitely see the difference, as it will be easier for you to get back to studying.

<u>	How to ace in exams:- </u>
</h2>

<b> 1. Get informed - </b> <br>
Don’t walk into your test unprepared for what you will face. Before you start studying, find out:
<li>textbook chapters and topics the test will cover</li>
<li> test format</li> <br>
Will there be multiple-choice questions or short answers? Will you write an in-class essay? The goals and layout of the test will determine how you tackle learning the material. <br><br>
<b> 2. Think like your teacher -</b> <br>
Your homeworks assignments, quizzes, handouts, daily notes, and classwork are all indicators of what your teacher thinks is important about the information and what might appear on the test. <br><br>
 
<b> 3. Practice for the inevitable-</b> <br>
Outline essays ahead of time. For math tests, do plenty of practice problems similar to ones that you KNOW will appear. Make a list of questions that you think might show up on the test (and then make sure you can answer them!).<br> <br>
<b> 4. Divide big concepts from smaller details- </b> <br>
If you're studying a big topic like: the Civil War for history or cellular processes for biology. try breaking the material you need to study into chunks. Study one battle at a time or one chapter section at a time—and then quiz yourself. Ask yourself questions about what you’ve just studied, and even write your answers down.<br><br>
<b> 5. Don’t neglect the “easy” stuff-</b> <br>
Even if you’ve been acing a certain subject or concept all year and think the test will be a breeze, you should still give it a review before the big day. You don’t want to lose points for careless errors or forget to memorize a key geometry  formula.

<u> Here are some tips to be more productive in your life:- </u>

	
</h2>
<b> 1. Create a work routine -</b> One of the most significant ways to work more productively is to get into a routine of waking up, working and taking breaks at around the same time each day.<br><br>
<b> 2. Set achievable work goals -</b> Setting yourself a range of goals is the perfect way to motivate yourself. This works whether you're aiming for some first class grade working within a monthly spending budget or even just trying to make it to every class that week.<br><br>

<b> 3. Work in time blocks -</b> Working in smaller 'blocks' can help you become more productive, as you can assign smaller bite-sized tasks to each block.<br><br>


<b> 4. Reward yourself -</b> Striking a task off your to-do list is satisfying on its own, but when you finish a task, consider rewarding yourself with something you enjoy to keep yourself motivated!
<br><br>

<b> 5. Prioritize your daily tasks to achieve - </b> At the end of the day, make sure your tasks have been carried out, and if they haven't, put them back on your to-do list. Carry them out on the next day according to their priority, but try not to fall behind!<br><br>

<b> 6.Manage your time -</b> Create a plan to help you organize your time and keep track of your daily tasks. You'll be more effective and feel in control of your day. Scheduling breaks is also helpful. Consider separating study subjects with breaks to help you focus.

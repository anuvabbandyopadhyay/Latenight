# Pomodoro
If you find yourself struggling to finish assignments before the deadline or getting to exams wishing you had found the time to study more you are not alone. Many students struggle with managing time for their studies, and in today‚Äôs interconnected busy world it is no wonder.

Thousands of students have been managing their study time with the Pomodoro Technique, which was created by Francesco Cirillo in 1999. The fact that his method has been widely used for over 20 years shows how effective it is.
The Pomodoro Technique works like this:

1.Decide what you want to accomplish and estimate how long you will study for. Then break your work into pomodoros.

2.Set a timer for 25 minutes, and start studying. (There are many pomodoro apps available for your phone, or follow along with someones study session on YouTube).

3.Minimize your distractions during the pomodoro interval. If a thought pops into your head write it down. If a friend calls let them know you will call them back 
later.. 

4.After 25 minutes take a short 5-10 minute break. Grab a coffee, go for a walk, call back your friend, or do something else relaxing.

5.Repeat. After 4 pomodoros take a longer break for 20-30 minutes.
